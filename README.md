Learning how to use github

I am Stephen Teite Sampson from Nigeria. I have a vision to be a full stack web developer and I am committed in achieving that dream.
I currently have a very good understanding of HTML5 and CSS3.
My JavaScript knowledge is above average but I'm trying to upgrade myself.
I plan to acquiring advanced knowledge in nodejs, expressjs, reactjs and angular.
I realized that through hardwork and dedication, I'll achieve my dreams.
